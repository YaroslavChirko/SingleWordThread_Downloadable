# SingleWordThread_Downloadable
Just dumb fun project to refresh spring mvc, jdbc template and io streams knowledge.<br/>
It assigns random name to user and let's him post 1 word message (although full-on text can be posted without whitespaces).<br/>
Messages then can be downloaded, if desired, in txt format.
